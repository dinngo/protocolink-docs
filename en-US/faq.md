# ‚ùì FAQ

### 1. Is Protocolink open source?

We have open-sourced all our contracts and SDKs, except for the API. This enables developers to save time on research and focus on building products for users by either building upon the SDKs or accessing the API.

* [Protocolink Contract GitHub](https://github.com/dinngo/protocolink-contract)
* [Protocolink JS SDK GitHub](https://github.com/dinngo/protocolink-js-sdk)
* [Protocolink Logics GitHub](https://github.com/dinngo/protocolink-logics)

### 2. How do we decide which protocol to implement?

Protocolink has the ability to interact with any contract. Our **API/SDK** provides developers with the ability to develop applications more quickly for certain protocol logic. If you do not have a desired protocol logic to use, you can [submit pull requests (PRs)](https://github.com/dinngo/composable-router-logics) for integration. We will implement them based on **security**, **requirements**, and **cost**.

### **3. What problems does** Protocolink solve**?**

1. The popularity of Web3 has led to an explosion in the number of protocols, and users have more demands on the **user experience**.
2. Existing features require users to leave your product to perform certain actions.
   1. Provide a link to other services and allow users to return after completing the operation.
   2. Learn to write smart contract and add it to the service so that it can be completed in one step.
3. Method 2-2 provides a better experience but also incurs many costs.
   1. There are several factors to consider, such as how much approval amount to add to the logic.
   2. Different chains and protocols have different interfaces, each of which takes time to learn.
   3. Changes to the application contract are expensive to redeploy or maintain every time.
4. Protocolink can **aggregate** multiple protocols to make them more accessible to users. We have focused on the "**composable**" feature of blockchain for several years to **reduce development costs** and provide a **better user experience**.

### 4. Why is composability important?

In the Web3 blockchain, the composability feature of smart contracts enables innovation because it allows anyone to adapt or build on top of existing programs. This composability leads to more options and a better user experience, unlocking new use cases that did not exist in Web2 traditional finance. We believe that composability presents infinite possibilities for new features for those who want to be at the forefront of Web3 innovation.
