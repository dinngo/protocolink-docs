# ðŸ”® Overview

Protocolink is protocol-agnostic. All protocol-related code is defined in the [protocolink-logics](https://github.com/dinngo/protocolink-logics) repository instead of in the contracts. Protocolink also offers an [API](https://docs.protocolink.com/integrate-api/overview) and an [SDK](https://docs.protocolink.com/integrate-js-sdk/overview) for developers to create transactions.

**When a user tries to execute a transaction**

* ERC-20 tokens are transferred through the [Permit2](https://github.com/Uniswap/permit2).
* The data is passed to an **exclusive Agent** through the Router.
* The Agent transfers tokens from the user and executes the data.
* After the data is executed, the Agent returns tokens back to the user.

**Protocolink contracts consist of**

* [**Router**](router.md): The single entry point for users to interact with. The Router forwards the data to an Agent when executing a transaction.
* [**Agent**](agent.md): The execution unit of user transactions. The Agent executes the data like token transfer, liquidity provision, and yield farming.
* [**Callback**](callback.md): The entry point for protocol callbacks to re-enter the Agent in a transaction.
* [**Utility**](utility.md): The extensions for the Agent to perform extra actions like interacting with specific protocols, calculating token prices, and managing user data.
