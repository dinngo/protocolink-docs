# ðŸ”® Overview

Protocolink is protocol-agnostic. All protocol-related code is defined in the [protocolink-logics](https://github.com/dinngo/protocolink-logics) repository instead of in the contracts. Protocolink also offers [Broken link](broken-reference "mention") and [Broken link](broken-reference "mention") for developers to create transactions.

**When a user tries to execute a transaction**

* ERC-20 tokens are transferred through the [Permit2](https://github.com/Uniswap/permit2).
* The data is passed to an **exclusive Agent** through the Router.
* The Agent transfers tokens from the user and executes the data.
* After the data is executed, the Agent returns tokens back to the user.

**Protocolink contracts consist of**

* [router.md](router.md "mention"): The single entry point for users to interact with. The Router forwards the data to an Agent when executing a transaction.
* [agent.md](agent.md "mention"): The execution unit of user transactions. The Agent executes the data like token transfer, liquidity provision, and yield farming.
* [callback.md](callback.md "mention"): The entry point for protocol callbacks to re-enter the Agent in a transaction.
* [utility.md](utility.md "mention"): The extensions for the Agent to perform extra actions like interacting with specific protocols, calculating token prices, and managing user data.
