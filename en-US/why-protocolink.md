  protocol interactions within a secure Router/Agent architecture in a single
  transaction.

# ðŸŒŸ Why Protocolink?

### **Simplicity and Efficiency**&#x20;

* Protocolink integrates with [**Permit2**](use-cases/permit2-amplifier.md), saving users who have existing allowances fees from having to send token approval transactions again.
* Protocolink aggregates transactions, enabling users to send batched transactions to save gas.
* Protocolink provides an [**API**](broken-reference) and an [**SDK**](broken-reference) which:
  * Empowers developers to leverage the full composability of blockchain protocols without writing smart contracts.
  * Enables teams to deliver the minimum viable product with limited resource bandwidth.

### Security and Extensibility

* Protocolink smart contracts are non-upgradable, protecting users from unforeseen upgrades or changes to the contract.
* Protocolink is extensible, facilitating pull requests created by TypeScript contributors. This allows Protocolink to provide custom features for any project.
* Protocolink mitigates the risks of integrating any new protocols. New integrations have no effects on existing features and therefore require no additional contract audits!

### Endless **Possibilities**

* Protocolink includes no whitelist mechanism, empowering users and developers to aggregate any transactions to enjoy the real decentralized experience.
* Protocolink supports not only ERC20 but ERC721 and ERC1155 which are widely adopted by DeFi and NFT projects.
* Protocolink provides the latest blockchain experiences. New integrations are coming thanks to our contributors.
