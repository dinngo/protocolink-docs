# Zap-in & Zap-out

## Current Situation

Most services require the consumption or generation of specific tokens, which allows users to directly access the services without affecting their asset configuration. This lowers the barriers to entry for various services.

## Zap any Token in / out

By using the router with Permit2, users can have a better experience in cross-protocol token authorization, and the Router can combine multiple transactions at once. For example, integrating  DEX Swap functionality before or after means users can use any token input into any protocol function, or exchange it into any token when withdrawing tokens.
