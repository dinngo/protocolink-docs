## Creativity is Unlimited

By virtue of its composability, the blockchain provides you with the ability to accomplish tasks that are beyond the scope of the Web2 universe. You can use this feature to construct your own applications in a modular fashion, much like assembling Lego pieces. With our platform and your ingenuity, the potential for developing novel applications is endless.
