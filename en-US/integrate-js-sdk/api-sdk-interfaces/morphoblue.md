# Morphoblue

In this section, we will introduce the Morphoblue SDK interfaces, which provide developers with a convenient and efficient way to interact with the Morphoblue protocol. These interfaces cover various aspects of the protocol, including supply, supply-collateral, withdraw, withdraw-collateral, borrow, repay, and flash-loan. They are designed to be used easily and flexibly.

Before we dive into the SDK interfaces, we would like to provide an overview of the features of Morphoblue. If you are already familiar with Morphoblue, feel free to skip this section. For those who are new to Morphoblue, here's a brief explanation:

Morphoblue is a singleton contract that manages user balances without minting any tokens.

Each market in Morphoblue is independent, meaning that any action performed on the protocol must specify which market it's interacting with.

Once you have identified the market you want to interact with, you can choose to either be a Lender or a Borrower. Let's take the WETH(USDC, 90%, Chainlink, AdaptiveCurveIRM) market as an example:

* If you want to be a Lender, you need to supply WETH as the loan token.
* If you want to be a Borrower, you must deposit USDC as the collateral token and borrow WETH as the loan token.

Please note that Morphoblue is subject to change and improvements, and we will update our SDK accordingly.

The following section will introduce the interfaces related to the Morphoblue protocol, which can be accessed through the `api.protocols.morphoblue.` prefix.

## Supply

      decimals: number;
      symbol: string;
      name: string;
    };
    amount: string;
  };
}
```
