# Compound V3

In this section, we will introduce the Compound V3 SDK interfaces, which provide developers with a convenient and efficient way to interact with the Compound V3 protocol. These interfaces cover various aspects of the protocol, including supply, withdraw, borrow, repay, and claim, and are designed to be easy to use and flexible.

Before we dive into the SDK interfaces, we would like to provide an overview of the features of Compound V3. If you are already familiar with Compound V3, feel free to skip this section. For those who are new to Compound V3, here's a brief explanation:

Each market in Compound V3 is independent, meaning that any action performed on the protocol must specify which market it's interacting with. For example, Ethereum has markets for USDC and ETH. Polygon has a USDC market.

Once you have identified the market you want to interact with, you can choose to either be a Lender or a Borrower.&#x20;

* If you want to be a Lender, you need to supply the base token, such as USDC in the Ethereum USDC market. In return, the market will mint cUSDCv3 tokens for you.
* If you want to be a Borrower, you must deposit non-base tokens as collateral and borrow base token. For instance, in the Ethereum USDC market, you can deposit ETH or WBTC as collateral, but the market won't mint any cTokens for you. Instead, it will update the collateral value in the contract, and you can then borrow USDC.

Please note that Compound V3 is subject to change and improvements, and we will update our SDK accordingly.

In the following section, we will introduce the interfaces related to the Compound V3 protocol, which can be accessed through the `api.protocols.compoundv3.` prefix.
